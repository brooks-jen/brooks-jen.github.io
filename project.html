            <div class="What">
            <h3 class="smalltitle"> What is Quartz? </h3>
              <p> Quartz is a file storage software as a solution (SaaS) company that uses the cloud so users can access their data from any location or device. Quartz allows users to easily save and share their inspiration with others. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="Problem">
              <h3 class="smalltitle"> Problem </h3>
                <p> Saving information directly to a device isn’t practical for users on the move. With multiple devices being used and the need for effortless collaboration, cloud storage still has room to grow for users needs. Difficult set up processes and confusing interfaces are some of the major design issues facing this market. Many new users are too intimidated by set up process to try it out, while existing users aren’t satisfied with the current offerings visual organization. </p>
              </div>
              <div class="Solution">
              <h3 class="smalltitle"> Solution </h3>
                <p> Quartz sets out to eliminate these headaches and present a seamless approach for existing and new users. By designing a clearly organized dashboard, users are free to create and collaborate on projects without being bogged down by clunky interfaces. </p>

            <h2 class="big title"> User Research </h2>
            <p> In order to determine which features the app must have from the beginning, I surveyed users to see how they currently use similar cloud storage technology. From these surveys I wanted to understand if there were currently any blockers for people not using cloud storage that could be addressed by my designs. For those users familiar with cloud storage I wanted to know their most used features are so I could better understand what best serves users needs. </p>

          <h2 class="big title"> Competitive Analysis </h2>
          <div class="row">
            <p> The world of cloud storage has many competitors offering much for Quartz to learn from and build upon. Creating a SWOT analysis of some of the industry leaders like Dropbox, Sugarsync, and Google Drive, can shed light on what works well and what needs improvement. Gaining a better understanding of the field can help me make the right design decisions early and avoid making similar mistakes. </p>

        </div>
          <div class="medium row">
            <p> From the analysis it was clear that Quartz could enter the arena by creating a more open environment for file sharing and by providing competitive pricing for increased storage space. We want to get users engaged and talking about Quartz to help increase the base users. </p>

Sometimes Sarah accesses her work from school computers rather than her own so it is extremely convenient that she can access everything via one account. She also uses cloud storage to upload intersting content she finds when  browing the internet. She has a lot of different things going on so organization features are key to keeping track of everything

            <h2 class="big title"> User Stories </h2>
              <p> With the groundwork of research laid out, I created user stories based on everything I gathered of our potential users. Listing out each task and the level of importance helped shape what would become the minimum viable product (MVP). You can take a closer look at the user stories here. </p>

            <h2 class="big title"> Branding </h2>
              <p> In researching cloud storage I came across crystal storage which utilizes quartz crystals to store data without worry of corruption. Thus Quartz was born. It stood out from other company names while still maintaining a connection to storage. The color pallet was the next big branding decision and I decided on colors often associated with crystals like pinks, blues, and purples. I included a bright violet for call to action moments within the app. The logo is a basic crystalline shape and can be styled with different colors to create an abstract Q. I wanted something that used basic geometric shapes so that it can be broken down or built upon further for other aspects of the site. </p>

            <h2 class="big title"> Prototype </h2>
              <p> I created two prototypes during this project, one low fidelity (wireframes) and one high fidelity (mockups). I used balsamiq to develop the low fidelity prototype and sketch to create my high fidelity prototype. For both sets of prototypes I used InDesign to conduct user tests remotely and in person. You can see the low fidelity prototypes here and the high fidelity prototypes here. </p>

              <p> Time to see how users interact with the designs. User testing with low fidelity wireframes and high fidelity mockups helped reveal the design decisions that worked well and what fell flat. During the low fidelity testing, I really got to see users expectations of design because of the minimal aesthetic/information available. This helped determine that the layout was intuitive enough for users to do basic tasks without much detail. From the high fidelity mockup user testing I learned if the more brand related decisions (color, font size, imagery) worked with users. I also conducted A/B testing with the high fidelity mockups to determine what potential design layouts users preferred.</p>

            <h2 class="big title"> Reflections </h2>
              <p> As my first design project from start to finish I learned many valuable things throughout the process. I saw some of my design decisions make sense right away like keeping action buttons using the bright purple for continuity. Certain design decisions failed and needed to be reworked, like the organization of the upgraded account process. I learned that early organization of a project’s assets leads to much easier iterations in the future. Since creating high fidelity mockups is time consuming, the more user testing that can be done with low fidelity versions the faster you can work out any issues that arise. Overall, I gained a lot of knowledge about the design process of a project from start to finish. </p>
